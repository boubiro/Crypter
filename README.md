## More Info (Intended Use):
Created in 2011. All code is original 2011 code.  
I created this to act as an extreme password manager ... steps to follow:

1. Think of simple memorable random password (i.e. gmail for gmail)
2. Hash it using whichever function corresponds to password rules & slice it if necessary (use first 11 characters of hash) (see pic1)
3. In a text doc somewhere come up with a secret question and write it in the doc. Come up with corresponding answer
4. Use the answer as the key, password + instructions as the text, and save the encrypted result into text doc (see pic2)
5. Conclusion: complicated and annoying, but worked quite well
